FAQ
------

* **Can I query by TNS/ZTF name?:** No. Do a cone search.
WHY?: Because it's too low on our priority list and we don't have the time. If it's a really big deal for you and you might have working hours to help us with this, get in touch.

* **Can I do a cone search? :** Not yet. Poke us if we've not done it by February 2025.

* **Why does the API return so much data?:** Because it'd take forever to refactor and it's low on the priority list. If it's a big deal for you talk to us, it might bump it further up the to-do list.
